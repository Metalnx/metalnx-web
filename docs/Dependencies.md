This post lists all dependencies for the Metalnx Web application.

# Web Application

### Java
Java 1.8 or higher

### iRODS
iRODS 4.1.8+ or 4.2.0+

### Python
Python 2.7

### Web Server
Tomcat 7 or higher

    $ sudo yum -y install tomcat
    $ sudo apt-get -y install tomcat7

### Database

#### MySQL
MySQL 5.6 or higher

#### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL 9.2 or higher

    $ sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
    $ sudo postgresql-setup initdb
    $ sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf

Find the following lines:

    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            ident
    host    all             all             ::1/128                 ident

Replace `ident` with `md5` or `trust`:

    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
    host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5

Save `pg_hba.conf` and exit. After this configuration, Postgres is now configured to allow password authentication. Now start and enable PostgreSQL:

    $ sudo systemctl start postgresql
    $ sudo systemctl enable postgresql

There are two packages used by the Metalnx setup script: `pyscopg2` for PostgreSQL and `mysqldv` for MySQL. They are used to check whether or not the credentials entered are correct and Metalnx has access to the database. To install those packages, please run the following commands according to your OS distribuition:

### `RPM`
	# yum install python-psycopg2	     # PostgreSQL
	# yum install MySQL-python           # MySQL

### `DEB`
	# apt-get install python-psycopg2    # PostgreSQL
	# apt-get install python-mysqldb     # MySQL

# Manual Build 
This section describes the dependencies *only necessary* to *build* the Metalnx Web project. **If you are only installing Metalnx via `rpm` or `deb` packages, you can skip this section**.

If you want to build the Metalnx Web project manually, first ensure that you installed all dependencies listed in the section above before you proceed.

Metalnx depends on Maven 3.1 or higher. Before starting, you should have already installed Maven in your environment. Maven is a Apache project available at [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apacke.org/download.cgi). This website provides download links and you can also find a Maven overview and how to integrate the tool in your system.  

You can typically install Maven via a package manager like `yum` or `apt-get`.  For example:
```
# yum install maven
```

If you desire to build the `rpm` or `deb` package versions of Metalnx you will need the approriate build tools.   For `rpm` packages that tool is `rpm-build`.

```
# yum install rpmdevtools rpm rpm-devel rpm-build
```

For `deb` packages, the tool is `dpkg-dev`:
```
# apt-get install dpkg-dev
```

# Docker Container

* [Docker 1.9.1](https://www.docker.com/)
* Metalnx source code (specifically the `packaging/docker` folder), (*This is needed if you are building the container locally*)
* Metalnx `war` file already built (refer to **Metalnx Build Guide**), (*This is needed if you are building the container locally*)
* Access to the Internet. The container building process needs to get files from the CentOS central repository in order to get the base system running.

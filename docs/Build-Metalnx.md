This post guides you through the Metalnx Web compilation pipeline. It explains how to build Metalnx Web from scratch.

**If you have already installed Metalnx following the [Getting Started](https://github.com/Metalnx/metalnx-web/wiki/Getting-Started) notes, this step is not required.**

Before going any further, make sure you have installed all [dependencies](https://github.com/Metalnx/metalnx-web/wiki/Dependencies#manual-build) necessary to build Metalnx.

# Metalnx Repository

Ensure you have the Metalnx git repository in your environment. The Metalnx repository should be as follows:

* src
* packaging
* docs
* contrib
* README
* LICENSE

The `src` folder is where the Metalnx application code is located. It contains all files that will be compiled and, after the compilation, it will also contains the Metalnx Web application. 

# Metalnx Compilation Pipeline

Once you have successfully installed Maven (use the `mvn --version` command to  check that), you can build Metalnx. As a Java, Web-based application, Metalnx will be available as a [war](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19316-01/820-3748/aduvz/index.html) file at the end of the compilation process. 

Browse to the Metalnx `src` folder in the repository you cloned from the git repository. Listing the `src` folder content you should see:

    emc-metalnx-core
    emc-metalnx-services
    emc-metalnx-shared
    emc-metalnx-ui-admin
    emc-metalnx-web
    pom.xml

Under the source folder run the following command for a quickstart:

    $ mvn clean generate-sources package -Ppreprod -Dmaven.test.skip=true 

## Understanding the `mvn` command:

Maven is based around the central concept of a [build lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html). The *clean* phase cleans the project's working directory, *generate-sources* generates source code for inclusion in compilation, *package* takes the compiled code and package it in its distribution format, in this case the format is `war`.

You do not have to worry about downloading any dependencies. Maven will take care of that for you. Any other package that Metalnx requires will be downloaded from the [Maven repository](http://mvnrepository.com/). 

After downloading all dependencies, Maven will build all Metalnx subprojects in the following order: *emc-metalnx-core*, *emc-metalnx-services*, *emc-metalnx-shared*, *emc-metalnx-ui-admin* and *emc-metalnx-web*.

## Finding the `war` file

When build is completed, you will get a **BUILD SUCCESS** message. Now, the Metalnx `war` file exists and it is ready to be deployed. The `war` file is named `emc-metalnx-web.war` and it can be found under `metalnx-web/emc-metalnx-web/target`.

## Deploying the Metalnx `war` file

With the `emc-metalnx-web.war` file in hand, it is easy to deploy it in on an Apache Tomcat server. 

There are few different ways to deploy `war` files in a Tomcat instance. In this tutorial, we will deploy Metalnx through the Tomcat Manager App available at `http://{your-tomcat-host}:{your-tomcat-port}/manager/html`.

Once on this application manager page, you can select the `war` file to deploy (under the *Deploy*) section, find `emc-metalnx-web.war` on your file system, select it, and click deploy. 

*This operation may take a few minutes to complete.*

*If you want to create `rpm` or `deb` packages for Metalnx, proceed to the [Package Metalnx](https://github.com/Metalnx/metalnx-web/wiki/Package-Metalnx) post.*

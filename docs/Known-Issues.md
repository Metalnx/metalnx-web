# No visual indication on the copy modal that a copy is underway (v.1.3.0)

On the collections page, when the user clicks "Copy" there is no way for the user to tell whether or not the operation is actually going on. Even though as soon as the "Copy" button is clicked Metalnx starts copying the files, there is not a visual indication that the operation really started. A spinner or something like that will be added to the copy modal in order to indicate that the copy operation is running.
